          that shape the complex networks known as food webs formed
          by species and their feeding relationships. The topology of
          these networks is a major determinant of ecosystems'
          dynamics and is ultimately responsible for their responses
          to human impacts. Several simple models have been proposed
          for the intricate food webs observed in nature. We show
          that the three main models proposed so far fail to fully
          replicate the empirical data, and we develop a likelihood-
          based approach for the direct comparison of alternative
          models based on the full structure of the network. Results
          drive a new model that is able to generate all the
          empirical data sets and to do so with the highest

          to what extent we are making real progress in understanding
          ecological and evolutionary processes or just telling the
          same stories with fancy new words. I first present a biased
          overview of the development of network theory, focusing on
          its search for common patterns across seemingly different
          systems. I then proceed by discussing some applications of
          network theory in ecology, namely, species interactions,
          spatial ecology, epidemiology, and evolution in social
          groups. Finally, I suggest important contributions of the
          network approach such as identifying the consequences of
          heterogeneity for population and community dynamics,
          potential pitfalls, and future directions. (C) 2007

          contribute to the evolution of β-lactamase resistance to
          inhibitors and to new β-lactam antibiotics in bacterial
          pathogens, such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> We
          compiled a database of TEM β-lactamase sequences evolved
          under antibiotic pressure and identified functional
          interactions between individual residue positions We
          visualized these complex molecular interactions as a
          network and used network theory to derive information
          regarding the origin of individual mutations and their
          contribution to the observed resistance Our approach
          should help interpret sequence databases for clinically
          relevant proteins undergoing high mutation rates and under
          selective (drug, immune) pressure, such as surface proteins
          of pathogens (particularly of RNA viruses such as HIV) or
          targets for chemotherapy in microbial pathogen or tumor

          detailed phylogenetic or tertiary structure information for
          the target gene is not necessary Our analysis of how
          individual mutations work together to produce new
          biological activities should help anticipate evolution

  abstract  = "{Understanding the processes underlying food-web structure
          and organization remains one of the major tasks of ecology.
          While first attempts were mostly based on niche theory,
          with body size of species imposing a hierarchical structure
          for consumer species, it has been recently suggested that
          phylogenetic constraints may be more fundamental to
          understand who eats whom in natural communities. Models of
          food-web structure built on basic evolutionary assumptions
          are able to adequately reproduce the topology of real
          food-webs. Here, we analyze different implications of
          phylogenetic constraints on trophic structure, and present
          preliminary results. our exploration of the relationship
          between trophic and taxonomic similarity in food-webs shows
          that phylogeny and trophic structure are closely linked.
          interestingly, the relationship is stronger for trophic
          similarity between prey (similarity measured by shared
          predators species, or predatory similarity) than between
          consumer species (similarity measured by shared prey
          species, or dietary similarity). When relating body mass of
          prey and predators, slopes of major axis regressions within
          taxonomic groups differ markedly from the global pattern;
          similar differences between taxonomic levels appear when
          exploring the relationship between body mass of predators
          and the range in body mass of their prey, and vice versa.
          These results are important to understand how evolutionary
          processes shaping body sizes can affect food-web structure.

          large bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, held in an
          impoundment, changes markedly during feeding. The stomach
          cools rapidly on ingesting cold food. It then warms to a
          maximum of 10-15 {degrees}C above water temperature over a
          period of 12-20 h. Temperature decreases slowly over the
          next 20-30 h to a final state where it remains 3-6
          {degrees}C above water temperature. The viscera are
          thermally isolated. Conductive heat losses are reduced by
          an overlying gas bladder and by the thick fatty muscle of
          the body wall. Convective heat losses are prevented by heat
          exchangers in the circulation. The temperature rise can be
          accounted for by heat released in the hydrolytic processes
          of digestion and by an increase in metabolic rate. The
          elevated temperatures should speed digestion and allow the
          tuna to feed frequently when food is abundant. ",

          species interaction networks, such as food webs, remain
          elusive, but recent work suggests that the distribution and
          strength of trophic links play an important role. Potential
          omnivory-stability relationships have been investigated and
          debated extensively, but we still have a relatively poor
          understanding of how levels of omnivory relate to the
          stability of diverse food webs. Here, we use an
          evolutionary assembly model to investigate how different
          trade-offs in resource use influence both food web
          structure and dynamic stability during the assembly
          process. We build on a previous model by allowing
          speciation along with the evolution of two traits: body
          size and feeding-niche width. Across a wide range of
          conditions, the level of omnivory in a food web is
          positively related to its dynamic instability (variability
          and species turnover). Parameter values favoring omnivory
          also allow a wider range of phenotypes to invade, often
          displacing existing species. This high species turnover
          leaves signatures in reconstructed phylogenies, with
          shorter branches connecting extant species in more
          omnivorous food webs. Our findings suggest that features of
          the environment may influence both trophic structure and
          dynamic stability, leading to emergent omnivory-stability
          relationships.}",

  abstract  = "{A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to
          understand how the complexity observed in nature can
          persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is
          essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually
          mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental
          perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and
          invasions of exotic species. Ecological networks can be
          subdivided into three broad types: `traditional' food webs,
          mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks. There is
          a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network
          types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to
          phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of
          network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to
          explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic
          networks and host-parasitoid networks, and of body size in
          food webs. Research into ecological networks has recently
          undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new
          catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and
          quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been
          unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the
          distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration
          of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs
          network stability and structure. Another significant
          advance is the growing recognition of the importance of
          individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all,
          occur between individuals. The new generation of
          high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from
          describing networks based on species-averaged data and to
          start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such
          refinements will enable us to address more general
          ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the
          recent metabolic theory of ecology. We conclude by
          suggesting a number of `dead ends' and `fruitful avenues'
          for future research into ecological networks.}",

  abstract  = "{Food-chain length, the number of feeding links from the
          basal species to the top predator, is a key characteristic
          of biological communities. However, the determinants of
          food-chain length still remain controversial. While
          classical theory predicts that food-chain length should
          increase with increasing resource availability, empirical
          supports of this prediction are limited to those from
          simple, artificial microcosms. A positive resource
          availability-chain length relationship has seldom been
          observed in natural ecosystems. Here, using a theoretical
          model, we show that those correlations, or no
          relationships, may be explained by considering the dynamic
          food-web reconstruction induced by predator's adaptive
          foraging. More specifically, with foraging adaptation, the
          food-chain length becomes relatively invariant, or even
          decreases with increasing resource availability, in
          contrast to a non-adaptive counterpart where chain length
          increases with increasing resource availability; and that
          maximum chain length more sharply decreases with resource
          availability either when species richness is higher or
          potential link number is larger. The interactive effects of
          resource availability, adaptability and community
          complexity may explain the contradictory effects of
          resource availability in simple microcosms and larger
          ecosystems. The model also explains the recently reported
          positive effect of habitat size on food-chain length as a
          result of increased species richness and/or decreased
          connectance owing to interspecific spatial segregation.}",

  abstract  = "Speciation is the ``elephant in the room'' of community
          ecology. As the ultimate source of biodiversity, its
          integration in ecology's theoretical corpus is necessary to
          understand community assembly. Yet, speciation is often
          completely ignored or stripped of its spatial dimension.
          Recent approaches based on network theory have allowed
          ecologists to effectively model complex landscapes. In this
          study, we use this framework to model allopatric and
          parapatric speciation in networks of communities and focus
          on the relationship between speciation, richness, and the
          spatial structure of communities. We find a strong
          opposition between speciation and local richness, with
          speciation being more common in isolated communities and
          local richness being higher in more connected communities.
          Unlike previous models, we also find a transition to a
          positive relationship between speciation and local richness
          when dispersal is low and the number of communities is
          small. Also, we use several measures of centrality to
          characterize the effect of network structure on diversity.
          The degree, the simplest measure of centrality, is found to
          be the best predictor of local richness and speciation,
          although it loses some of its predictive power as
          connectivity grows. Our framework shows how a simple
          neutral model can be combined with network theory to reveal
          complex relationships between speciation, richness, and the
          spatial organization of populations."

          in ecology and evolutionary biology, the recent increase in
          the amount and availability of biological data has, placed
          a new focus on the complex networks embedded in biological
          systems. The increased availability of computational tools
          to store and retrieve biological data has facilitated wide
          access to these data, not just by biologists but also by
          specialists from the social sciences, computer science,
          physics and mathematics. This fusion of interests has led
          to a burst of research on the properties and consequences
          of network structure in biological systems. Although
          traditional measures of network structure and function have
          started us off on the right foot, an important next step is
          to create biologically realistic models of network
          formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent
          applications of network thinking to the evolution of
          networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics
          and stability of communities. These studies have provided
          new insights into the organization and function of
          biological systems by applying existing techniques of
          network analysis. The current challenge is to recognize the
          commonalities in evolutionary and ecological applications
          of network thinking to create a predictive science of

          affect the structure and dynamics of food webs, and other
          ecological networks, across multiple scales of
          organization. Measuring body size provides a relatively
          simple means of encapsulating and condensing a large amount
          of the biological information embedded within an ecological
          network. Recently, important advances have been made by
          incorporating body size into theoretical models that
          explore food web stability, the patterning of energy
          fluxes, and responses to perturbations. Because metabolic
          constraints underpin bodysize scaling relationships,
          metabolic theory offers a potentially useful new framework
          within which to develop novel models to describe the
          structure and functioning of ecological networks and to
          assess the probable consequences of biodiversity change.}",
